### README for OS Smash Terminal

# OS Smash Terminal

Welcome to the OS Smash Terminal project! This project is an educational and practical implementation of a custom shell, designed to enhance low-level programming skills and provide in-depth knowledge of operating system concepts.

## Overview

The OS Smash Terminal is a simple Unix-like shell written in C++. It supports basic shell functionalities including command execution, job control, signal handling, and aliasing. This project is aimed at developers and students looking to deepen their understanding of how operating systems and shell environments work at a low level.

## Key Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute built-in and external commands with arguments.
- **Job Control**: Manage background and foreground processes.
- **Signal Handling**: Implement custom signal handlers for various POSIX signals.
- **Aliasing**: Create and use command aliases for efficiency.
- **Redirection and Pipes**: Support for input/output redirection and piping between commands.

## Skills and Concepts

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience with the following:

- **System Calls**: Utilize Unix system calls such as `fork()`, `exec()`, `waitpid()`, and `kill()`.
- **Process Management**: Understand process creation, termination, and synchronization.
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Implement pipes and signal-based communication.
- **Memory Management**: Handle dynamic memory allocation and avoid memory leaks.
- **Concurrency**: Manage concurrent processes and implement job control.
- **Low-Level Debugging**: Use tools like `gdb` and `valgrind` to debug and profile your code.
- **POSIX Standards**: Adhere to POSIX compliance for portability and standardization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have `g++` or any other C++ compiler installed.
- **Make**: Install `make` for building the project.
- **Git**: Version control system for cloning and managing the repository.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/leifer98/os_smash_terminal.git
   cd os_smash_terminal
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

3. **Run the shell**:
   ```sh
   ./smash
   ```

## Usage

Once you start the OS Smash Terminal, you can use it like a regular Unix shell. Here are a few commands to get you started:

- **Run a command**:
  ```sh
  ls -l
  ```

- **Create an alias**:
  ```sh
  alias ll='ls -l'
  ```

- **Run a background job**:
  ```sh
  sleep 100 &
  ```

- **List jobs**:
  ```sh
  jobs
  ```

- **Bring a job to the foreground**:
  ```sh
  fg %1
  ```
